# Lenovo_mainpage
A clon of Lenovo's main page 

This is my humble attempt of recreating the lenovos' main page (https://www.lenovo.com/co/es?Redirect=False) from scratch and make it look as similar as possible with my current knowlegde (Html + CSS)

What I used: basic html layout, vanilla css for the styling.

What I've learned: 
    use of flexbox for the navbar and footer,
    creating a flexbox container with grid elements inside, 
    grid template areas, 
    use of pseudoclasses,  
    hover effects for the cards, 
    use of the alpha value of rgba for making the 4 cards on the right section appear darker, 
    styiling elements with the span tag of html.
